# Intro to Artsy Coding
## What's Artsy Coding?
- This is a collection of exercises I found useful while learning coding for artistic (visual) purposes
- I will call the topic "artsy coding" to distance from several other terms
  - Procedural art / Procedurally generated art: the word has several associations with NFTs and well-established forms (like using code to drive a pen to draw something), but neither really fits the work below
  - Technical art: technical art is an umbrella term in game development that covers everything from asset pipelines to particles and post-processing effects. This set of exercises only cover a minuscule portion of it
  - Graphics programming: these exercises do not focus on exploring GPUs and their drivers
  - I am a hobbyist and not a professional. I am not going to even attempt to call this "artistic".
- The main goal is to get you familiar with some jargon people use when making their computers show fancy pictures, as well as getting a feel of the maths
  - When doing shader programming and other non-physically-based effects, it is crucial to be able to imagine different functions and pick the right ones
